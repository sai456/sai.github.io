    <h3><span>Title: </span>TEMPERATURE BASED SCAN AND GATE OPENING SYSTEM USING IOT TO FOLLOW COVID NORMS</h3>
    <h3><span>Description: </span>Since the outbreak of covid,infrared thermometers are being used as screening toolto scan the people at Airports, Railway Stations, and other crowded establishments. These scans are being used to identify potential patients of Covid-19. The government made it compulsory to scan everyone before entering the office, school, or any other crowded place. The first step to detect COVID is by scanning for fever. We have temperature checking systems for every entrance for scanning but manual temperature scanning has a lot of disadvantages.To solve this problem we here propose a fully automated temperature scanner and entry provider system.It is a multipurpose system that has a wide range of applications. The system makes use of a contactless temperature scanner. The main objective of the system (temperature scanning gate) is to monitor the human body temperature when a they passed through the gate. In normal situation the gate is always open. If the gate senses any high temperature (more than 99.0 degree Fahrenheit), the gates automatically rejects the entry by closing the gate. The gate also provides warning beeps while the body temperature of a person is high.</h3>
